					<h2>Key Skills</h2>
						<p>I am a very quick learner and I pick up many of my skills through others. While my code needs work, I have spent the past five+ years working in and out of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. The schooling I am under-taking has given me the rare opportunity to learn AfterEffects as well, and I happen to make a hobby out of graphic design, ,using my spare time to create pieces of art just for fun. I have an eye for style, and can easily head a design team. Consider my work 1 third coding, 2 thirds design.</p>
						<p> Despite my overall lack of experience, I am willing to argue I am no slouch. For instance, this page is mobile compatible, and will conform to smaller screens - a skill many verteran web devs have yet to master.  </p>
